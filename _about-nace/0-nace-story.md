We can help, not only to systematically put in place training systems and certifications, according to companies’ needs, but also help customise the training so that these gains will be long left within your organisation.

NACE draws on the expertise of international institutions - the Swiss Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (SFIVET), the German Chamber of Industry & Commerce (Akademie) and the Singaporean-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (SGC).
